## How To Do This Assignment

The general outline of this program has been provided for you.  Unfortunately, your boss did not follow his own advice and failed to write a Software Development Plan.  He will never admit it, but this is why he gave up and handed the project to you.  Don't make the same mistake!

Run through the entire Software Development Process once for *each individual tool*.  This means that for each tool you will write a little bit of text in each section of your [Software Plan](../doc/Plan.md).  The sub-tasks of this assignment are designed to be written one at a time to give you more practice with this process.  The tools are pretty easy to write if you do them in the right order.  Here ya go:

### Phase 0: Requirements Analysis
*(20% of your effort)*

**Important - do not change any code in this phase**

0.  Read the [Project Requirements](./Project_Requirements.md) to orient yourself with the project.
1.  Read the [Output Examples](./examples/) to learn what each tool should do.
    *   Understand what kind of output each tool makes when given *good inputs*.
    *   Understand what sorts of errors can happen when the tools are given *bad inputs*.
2.  Study the [Usage module](../src/Usage.py)
    *   It will help you understand the difference between *good* and *bad* inputs.
    *   Fortunately, this module is *complete* and *does not* require any changes from you.
    *   Use the REPL to learn how it works.  For example:
        *   ```
            $ python -i src/Usage.py
            >>> usage()
            Python Text Tools Usage:
            ========================
            ...

            >>> usage("An error message", "tac")
            Error: An error message

                tt.py cat|tac FILENAME...
                Concatenate and print files in order or in reverse
            ```
3.  **Do not change the source code in this phase of the project!**
    *   You will edit code in **Phase 2: Implementation**.
    *   In this phase your task is to *draft* the plan that you will follow when you get there.
4.  Take the **Starter Code Quiz** on Canvas.
    *   Do not worry if you can't answer all of the questions yet
    *   You can re-take the quiz as many times as you want before the assignment is due
5.  Fill out **Phase 0** in Plan.md; explain in your *own words* what the program does, how it does it, and what changes you expect to make.
6.  Track your time in Signature.md.


### Phase 1: Design
*(30% of your effort)*

**Important - do not change any code in this phase**

1.  Design tool functions on paper; **don't rewrite the Python code yet**.
    *   In this phase sketch them out in *pseudocode*.
    *   Walk through the pseudocode in your head, with a pad of paper or a whiteboard to convince yourself that your design will work.
2.  Write signatures and pseudocode for each tool in Plan.md.
    *   *Hint:* You do not need to write a signature or pseudocode for `Usage.usage()`; it has already been designed.
    *   *Hint:* The signature of each tool function found in the starter code is already good enough.
    *   Do not paste Python code into Plan.md; when we want to see your code we will read the `.py` files.
3.  You may write *some* runnable Python code to test out your ideas.
    *   This is called *prototyping*, and is a normal part of the design process.
    *   Do not become too attached to your prototype!
    *   Be prepared to delete prototype code after this phase.
    *   It helps to *not* write prototype code in the same files as *real* code.
4.  The [Output Examples](./examples) contain lots of good test cases.
    *   If you can think of any new test cases, you should write them down here!
5.  You should be able to get 100% on the **Starter Code Quiz** by now.
6.  Fill out **Phase 1** in Plan.md.
    *   This will be the longest portion of the document.
7.  Track your time in Signature.md.


### Phase 2: Implementation
*(15% of your effort)*

**Finally, you can write code!**

0.  By the end of this phase the program is runnable.
    *   **Do not** move on if your program crashes unexpectedly!
    *   Don't forget to **close all files** your tools use.
1.  Fill out **Phase 2** in Plan.md.
    *   As you work in this phase you may choose to deviate from the design you settled upon in the previous phase.  This is normal!
    *   Briefly explain what changed.
    *   Do not paste long passages of Python code in Plan.md.
    *   Your write-up for this phase may be very short.
2.  Track your time in Signature.md.


### Phase 3: Testing and Debugging
*(30% of your effort)*

0.  Run through the test cases suggested in the [Output Examples](./examples).
    *   The [Testing Scripts](../testing/README.md) are your friends!
1.  Run through any new test cases that you devised.
2.  Fill out **Phase 3** in Plan.md.
    *   Describe the tests cases you ran.
    *   Make note of the commands that you ran and what happened in the program.
3.  If you found bugs in this phase, explain what was wrong and how you fixed it.
4.  Track your time in Signature.md.


### Phase 4: Deployment
*(5% of your effort)*

It is your responsibility to ensure that your program will work on your grader's computer.

*   Code that crashes and *cannot* be quickly fixed by the grader will receive **0 points** on the relevant portions of the rubric.
*   Code that crashes but *can* be quickly fixed by the grader (or crashes only *some* of the time) will receive, at most, **half-credit** on the relevant portions of the rubric.

The following procedure is the best way for you to know what it will be like when the grader runs your code:

0.  Review [How to Submit this Assignment](./How_To_Submit.md) and make sure that your submission is correct.
1.  Push your code to GitLab, then check that all of your files and commits appear there.
2.  Clone your project into a *different directory*, and re-run your test cases.


### Phase 5: Maintenance

**Before The Due Date**

0.  Review Plan.md and Signature.md one last time.
1.  Fill out **Phase 5** in Plan.md by answering the questions.
2.  Make one final commit and push your **completed** Software Development Plan and Signature to GitLab.
3.  Make sure that you are happy with your **Starter Code Quiz** score.

**After You Submit (Can Happen After The Due Date)**

0.  Respond to the **Assignment Reflection Survey** on Canvas.


## What We Look for When Grading

        *   Each section filled out with a convincing level of detail
        *   No code is pasted from the source files
*   Time management (5 points)
    *   Signature.md contains accurate information about the time you spent on this project
        *   The time reported on the **TOTAL** entry is the sum of the daily entries
    *   The *TODO* message and the placeholder entries have been removed
*   Program Behavior (30 points)
    *   Program doesn't crash unexpectedly
    *   User Interface meets requirements
        *   Bad user input is detected and custom error messages provide an appropriate amount of detail
        *   File input/output issues cause Python's default stack trace message to appear
    *   Output is reasonably close to the examples
        *   *Small* differences in white space and formatting are tolerated
        *   Extra blank lines, duplicated lines, missing or extra commas *are not* small differences
    *   No external programs are called to do the work
        *   Do not use `os.system()`, `subprocess`, `pipes` or similar features.
        *   This is a pure Python program, not a shell script that leverages external programs.
    *   The program completely relies on user input to locate files
        *   Hard-coded paths are not written into the program
        *   All of the tools will work no matter what directory the program is started from
*   Code Quality (20 points)
    *   Doc strings and comments match the code they describe
    *   Functions are organized into the correct modules
    *   No useless variables or constants are present
    *   No useless import statements are present
    *   No extraneous print statments are left in the code (i.e. all of the `print("TODO: ...")` lines are deleted)
    *   Program *does not* import any modules **except**:
            *   `sys`
            *   `typing`
            *   modules provided by the starter code
            *   new modules you created yourself
        *   No import statement fail due to misspelling or incorrect capitalization.
            *   **Windows users** make sure that the capitalization of file names on GitLab match your `import` statements!
        *   No imports involve the `src.` package; this is the result of a PyCharm misconfiguration
    *   `sys.argv` is directly accessed only in `tt.py`
        *   Relevant portions of the command line is passed into each tool function
    *   `eval()` or similar functions must not be used; use `int()` to convert strings into numbers
    *   Data files are closed in ordinary situations
        *   In the event of an error, your program will display an error message and immediately exit without closing files
